# Sound buttons â€“ word-building game

A game to help learners construct words from individual sounds.

It's designed for use in guided one-to-one sessions with teachers, with the idea of using morphemes (in linguistics, the smallest grammatical unit of speech).

There are plenty of physical versions of games like this on the market. This is a prototype to test whether a cheaper online version could be made using native web technologies.

To get started, I cloned MDN's speak easy synthesis demo: https://mdn.github.io/web-speech-api/speak-easy-synthesis/ (which is available under a CC0 1.0 Universal license).
